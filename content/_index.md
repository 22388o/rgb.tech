## Why RGB? {.keypoints-large}

* Scalability
  
  RGB can scale in terms of transaction throughput, data size and network size.
  It doesn't keep any data on-chain (in any blockchain); it is sharded from the
  day 1 and is fully interoperable with layer 2 scalability solutions.

* Privacy

  RGB puts confidentiality and privacy to the top. It doesn't have on-chain 
  transaction graph trackable with chain analysis tools, it uses zero-knowledge
  to keep history of owned assets private -- and a user is always in-charge what
  and when to disclosure parts of the history, if needed.

* Bitcoin & Lightning

  RGB is a native member of Bitcoin and Lightning network ecosystem, brining
  reach smart contracts in a scalable way to the World's most secure and
  censorship-resistant cryptocurrency.

A number of exchanges has announced their plans to support RGB. These include
large players as Bitfinex, HodlHodl, as well as new startups, created around
RGB, like ColorShift and Portico. We will update this section once the first
exchanges will start trading RGB assets.

Server teams are also working on providing DEX facilities for trading RGB assets
on lightning. Most of these teams are working in the stealth mode.

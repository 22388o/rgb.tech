A number of exchanges have announced their plans to support RGB. These include
large players as: Bitfinex, HodlHodl, as well as new startups, created around
RGB, like ColorShift. We will update this section once the first
exchanges start trading RGB assets.

Server teams are also working on providing DEX facilities for trading RGB assets
on lightning. Most of these teams are working in private.

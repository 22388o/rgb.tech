Interested in understanding RGB or developing new forms of smart contracts? 
Check out the following guides:

* ### Writing contracts

  Simple RGB contracts can be created in **Rust** (using handy macros).
  More advanced contracts will require writing code for **AluVM** in
  **AluAssembly language**. We also work on a new high-level language called
  **Contractum**, which release is targeted towards the end of the year.

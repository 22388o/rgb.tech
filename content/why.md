* ### Scalability

  RGB can scale in terms of transaction throughput, data size and network size.
  It doesn't keep any data on-chain (in any blockchain); it is sharded from the
  day 1 and is fully interoperable with layer 2 scalability solutions.

* ### Privacy

  No chain analysis is possible due to the absence of transaction graph in 
  blockchain. RGB uses zero-knowledge to protect the history of a fungible state.
  With RGB, user is always in-charge what and when to disclosure parts of the 
  history and state, if needed.

* ### Bitcoin & Lightning

  RGB is a native member of Bitcoin and Lightning network ecosystem, bringing
  rich smart contracts in a scalable way to the World's most secure and
  censorship-resistant cryptocurrency.

To try out RGB you have to install the appropriate libraries and software. Depending
on your use case you may need to install:

* ### RGB Command-line

    For power desktop users, the best way to experience RGB is to use `rgb`
    command-line tool which, similarly to `git` command, performs all operations
    with RGB smart contracts.

* ### RGB Node

    RGB Node is a daemon/service which runs in the background, provides RPC API,
    and allows you to always be online and accept incoming RGB transfers without 
    any third-party server.

* ### Wallets

    Wallets provide graphical user interface for RGB. If you plan to
    transact with RGB assets or use RGB contracts, the best way to start is to 
    install one of the existing wallets.

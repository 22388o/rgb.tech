RGB is a scalable & confidential smart contracts system for Bitcoin & lightning
network developed by the [LNP/BP Association](https://www.lnp-bp.org). It 
embraces concept of private & mutual ownership and is a "post-blockchain", 
Turing-complete form of trustless distributed computing which does not require 
introduction of tokens.

* ### Understand RGB

  RGB is much more complex than simple bitcoin applications; to unlock its true
  power in creating the world of Bitcoin Finance (#BiFi) it is important
  to understand its terminology and internal architecture in details. A good
  starting point can be through multiple RGB learning resources.

* ### Program RGB

  Simple RGB contracts can be created in **Rust** (using handy macros).
  More advanced contracts will require writing code for **AluVM** in
  **AluAssembly language**. We also work on a new high-level language called
  **Contractum**, which release is targeted towards the end of the year.

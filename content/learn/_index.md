embraces concept of private & mutual ownership and is a "post-blockchain", 
Turing-complete form of trustless distributed computing which does not require 
introduction of tokens.

* ### Program RGB

  Simple RGB contracts can be created in **Rust** (using handy macros).
  More advanced contracts will require writing code for **AluVM** in
  **AluAssembly language**. We also work on a new high-level language called
  **Contractum**, which release is targeted towards the end of the year.

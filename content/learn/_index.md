RGB is a scalable & confidential smart contracts system for Bitcoin & lightning
network. It embraces concept of private & mutual ownership and is a
"post-blockchain", Turing-complete form of trustless distributed computing which
does not require introduction of tokens.

RGB is being developed by the [LNP/BP Association](https://www.lnp-bp.org).
The development is lead by [Maxim Orlovsky](https://dr.orlovsky.ch) and
re-shapes earlier prototypes and ideas by Giacomo Zucco and Peter Todd on
client-side-validation and tokens into a full smart contract system.

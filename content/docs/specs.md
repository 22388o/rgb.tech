* ### Black paper

  Unlike an ICO "whitepaper", the RGB blackpaper systematically explains RGB, its
  capabilities, applications and most importantly, does not shill any tokens.

* ### Yellow paper

  Yellow paper gives a formal description of RGB system in terms of distributed
  computing and computer science. It is a work-in-progress and will be released
  later this year.

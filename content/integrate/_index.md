* ### Integrate With Local Bitcoin Regtest Env

  To start working with RGB, you can use a local Bitcoin regtest environment. This is a good way to start experimenting
  with RGB without the need to use real bitcoins. You can use
  the [Bitlight RGB Local Development Environment](https://github.com/bitlightlabs/bitlight-local-env-public)

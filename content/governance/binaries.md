RGB command-line tool and RGB node are two main user-facing tools which can
be used by power users of RGB on desktops and server-side. They are developed 
and maintained by the [LNP/BP Standards Association](LNP/BP), but it is advised
that alternative implementations will be written by independent bodies. These
implementations may be audited by the Association to ensure compatibility.

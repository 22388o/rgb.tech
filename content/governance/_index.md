RGB is a stack of protocols abstracted into a layered design with different
governance structure and update policy.

**NB: Unlike in blockchain smart contract systems, where blockchain governance 
severely affects contract governance (contract transactions can be rolled back),
in RGB and client-side validation contracts are immutable, fully governed 
according to the terms specified by contract issuers in contract genesis & 
schema and can't be changed/updated via changes to RGB protocol stack.**

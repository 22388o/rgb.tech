# RGB smart contracts

RGB is a scalable & confidential smart contracts system for Bitcoin & lightning network. It embraces concepts of private & mutual ownership and is a "post-blockchain", Turing-complete form of trustless distributed computing which does not require introduction of tokens.

RGB is being developed by the [LNP/BP Association](https://www.lnp-bp.org). The development is lead by [Maxim Orlovsky](https://dr.orlovsky.ch) and re-shapes earlier prototypes and ideas by Giacomo Zucco and Peter Todd on client-side-validation and tokens into a full smart contract system.

NB: There is a [fork of the RGB smart contracts by Lightning Labs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1298/files#diff-a1a1055c3796351cc7dc66d909e09d61c764f7f8363e094c0fcf057d96170e5bR1129-R1131), originally called CMYK and known under the brand of _Taro_. Please be warned that this fork was not audited by RGB team and represents a very limited and restricted functionality not allowing smart contracts but suited only for token issuance.
